I was going to start this off with a screenshot from Google's autocomplete saying "Why do.... dogs eat poop?" but I thought that might be a little too low brow. So instead, I typed "Is security" and was greeted with, simply, "Is security worth it?" The way I see it, security should be like oxygen. Always there, not getting in the way, invisible. And, if it all disappears, you fall over.

Anyway, that's all completely besides my point. My point is actually how we used Google autocomplete to... well, let's just say to win an argument.

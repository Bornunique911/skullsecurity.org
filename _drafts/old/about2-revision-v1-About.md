Welcome to SkullSecurity!

I registered "skullsecurity.org" (along with .net and .com) a couple years ago, to host the site for a Shadowrun campaign that ended up with the same name (that's a long story, but maybe I'll tell it some day!). When I created it, I knew it'd be an awesome name for a security site or group or whatever, so I told myself that someday, I'd create a blog there. And here we are.

This blog is, as the tagline (currently) says, "just another security weblog". I've been in the security field for awhile now, and am doing some work that I consider interesting, and thought I'd start sharing it. If you want to know what I'm working on, or what I do for fun, or what I need to access later, check out my [wiki](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki "Wiki").

Anyway, with that aside, a little about myself. My name is Ron Bowes, I'm 25 and have a Bachelors of Computer Science (honours) from the University of Manitoba. I'm also a GIAC-certified penetration tester (GPEN), having completed the SANS 560 course (which, by the way, is a fantastic course!). I've worked at several security jobs since graduating, and am currently a security analyst (specializing in application security and penetration testing) for the Province of Manitoba. I can't really talk about my work there, but I can talk about my personal work.

I cut my teeth, security-wise, on reverse engineering games for Battle.net, for the purposes of writing emulation bots, non-malicious hacks/plugins, and just plain educational tinkering. To my knowledge, I'm the first to have publicly released code for [Warcraft 3 SRP](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/SRP), the [Lockdown Modules](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Lockdown), and [Warden](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Starcraft_Warden). One of my favourite things I wrote for Battle.net, in my programming infancy, was a [Message Spoofer](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/MessageSpoofer), which would allow users to send various control characters in their messages for effects like colours and alighment.

My work at the moment revolves around Microsoft's NetBIOS and SMB (aka, CIFS) protocols. Using a fantastic book called [Implementing CIFS](http://www.ubiqx.org/cifs/), by Christopher R. Hertel, I'm working on understanding how Windows systems talk to each other, on a low level, and how I can manipulate this to assist penetration testers. I'll post tools, guides, and whatever else I feel like here as I go, so keep an eye out!

If you have any questions, feel free to email me or post a response here!

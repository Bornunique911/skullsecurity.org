Hey folks,

You probably heard this week about [5 million @gmail.com accounts](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/09/11/google-says-not-to-worry-about-5-million-gmail-passwords-leaked/) posted. I've been researching it independently, and was hoping for some community help (this is *completely* unrelated to the fact that I work at Google - I just like passwords).

I'm reasonably sure that the released list is an amalgamation of a bunch of other lists and breaches. But I don't know what ones - that's what I'm trying to find out!

Which brings me to how you can help: people who can recognize which site their password came from. I'm trying to build a list of which breaches were aggregated to create this list, in the hopes that I can find breaches that were previously unreported!

**If you want to help:**


1. Check your email address on <https://haveibeenpwned.com/>
2. If you're in the list, email <ihazhacked@skullsecurity.org> **from the associated account**
3. I'll tell you the password that was associated with that account
4. And, most importantly, you tell me which site you used that password on!
In a couple days/weeks (depending on how many responses I get), I'll release the list of providers!

Thanks! And, as a special 'thank you' to all of you, [here are the aggregated passwords](https://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/alleged-gmail-with-count.txt.bz2) from the breach! And no, I'm not going to release (or keep) the email list. :)

Hey everybody,

This is just a super quick post today to direct you [here](http://www.skullspace.ca/blog/2012/11/skullspace-2-0-the-new-frontier/) - <http://www.skullspace.ca/blog/2012/11/skullspace-2-0-the-new-frontier/>.

That's a post I wrote about SkullSpace - the hackerspace that me and several others helped found a couple years ago. We went down a "too good to be true" road, where we had a ton of space and super cheap rent. And, eventually, got bitten by it. We're in the process of moving, and started a [fundraiser](http://www.indiegogo.com/skullspace) to make it happen.

Anyway, [read the post](http://www.skullspace.ca/blog/2012/11/skullspace-2-0-the-new-frontier/)! It's interesting. :)

Ron

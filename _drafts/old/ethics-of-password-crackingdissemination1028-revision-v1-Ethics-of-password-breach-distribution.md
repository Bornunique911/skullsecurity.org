It's rare these days for me to write blogs that I have to put a lot of thought into. Most of my writing is technical, which comes pretty naturally, but I haven't written an argument since I minored in philosophy. So, if my old Ethics or Philosophy profs are reading this, I'm sorry!

## Introduction

Anybody who follows my blog/work regularly know that I collect, crack, and disseminate password breaches. I have a [wiki page](/wiki/index.php/Passwords) devoted to breaches and dictionaries and I occasionally [do talks](https://deepsec.net/docs/speaker.html#PSLOT17) on the subject. And if you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iagox86), you'll see [regular](https://twitter.com/iagox86/status/17619856631275520) [updates](https://twitter.com/iagox86/status/17615145828089856) about password dictionaries.

The issue is, [not](https://twitter.com/brainwagon/status/17619256166322177) [everybody](http://twitter.com/SimonLR/statuses/17984868306653185) agrees with what I do (I was hoping to have more links in that sentence, but only two people actually said they thought it was wrong when I [asked for comments on Twitter](http://twitter.com/?status=@iagox86%20&in_reply_to_status_id=17983590822318080&in_reply_to=iagox86)). Fortunately, [many](https://twitter.com/nikhil_mitt/statuses/17994429797244928) [more](https://twitter.com/LenIsham/statuses/18005375303294976) [people](https://twitter.com/ChrisJohnRiley/statuses/17987742487027712) [agreed](https://twitter.com/mruef/statuses/17986098747670528) that I was doing something good. So I take that as a small victory...

Anyway, this post is going to cover some of the pros and cons of what I do, and why I think that I'm doing the right thing, helping the world, etc.

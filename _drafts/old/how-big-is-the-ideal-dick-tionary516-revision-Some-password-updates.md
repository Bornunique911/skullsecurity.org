Hey all,

As some of you know, I've been working on collecting leaked passwords/other dictionaries. I spent some time this week updating my wiki's [password page](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords). Check it out and let me know what I'm missing, and I'll go ahead and mirror it.

One of the most exciting things, at least to me, is the Rockyou.com passwords ([story](http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/rockyou-hacked/)). Back in 2009 (I realize that's a long time ago -- my friends would yell 'OLD!' if I tried talking about it on IRC), 32.6 **million** passwords were stolen from Rockyou.com through, I believe, SQL injection. This attack was incredibly useful, at least from my perspective, because that's a HUGE number of passwords, they weren't encrypted/hashed, and there was no policy. So basically, it's a look at the passwords people use when they aren't restricted.

I'm mirroring a few versions of the password list on my [password page](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords), so go grab a copy if you want one (warning: it's 50mb+ compressed). For now, here's some statistics I pulled:

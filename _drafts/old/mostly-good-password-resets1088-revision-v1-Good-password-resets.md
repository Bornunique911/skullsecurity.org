Hey,

This is part 3 to my 2-part series on password reset attacks ([Part 1](http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/2011/hacking-crappy-password-resets-part-1) / [Part 2](http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/2011/hacking-crappy-password-resets-part-2). Apparently, people enjoyed them, but I got the same question over and over: what's the RIGHT way to do this?

So, here's the thing. I like to break stuff, but I generally leave the fixing to somebody else. It's just safer that way, since I'm not really a developer or anything like that.

So, I'm going to continue the trend by looking at the password reset functions for three major pieces of opensource software - WordPress, SMF, and MediaWiki!

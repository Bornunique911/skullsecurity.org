Hey all,

For my SANS GPEN Gold certification (first Gold-certified analyst for GPEN -- go me!) I wrote a paper on my SMB scripts for Nmap. The paper is titled "[Scanning Windows Deeper With the Nmap Scanning Engine](http://www.giac.org/certified_professionals/practicals/GPEN/00049.php)". I started writing it a few months ago, and collaborated with Fyodor in the early stages. Hopefully it's a useful guide!

I talk a bit about the theory and protocols behind the scripts, then dive into a few of the more interesting ones and talk about how they work and how they can be used.

Let me know what you think!

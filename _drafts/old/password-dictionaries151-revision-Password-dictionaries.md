Greetings from 2009!

I have a real post planned for the near future, but for now you're stuck with something short (and probably more useful, ultimately). I just wanted to draw attention to a few password databases I put on my wiki. You can find them [here](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords).

First, the list included with **John the Ripper**. It's small, at 24kb, and is designed to be mutated/permutated. It's ordered by frequency, and the author has done a lot of research on common/weak passwords. There's a direct link [here](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/5/53/List-john.txt)

Next, the list included with **Cain and Able**. It's significantly larger (3.3mb) and is targeted toward local cracking. The list I've uploaded it alphabetized, I'm not sure whether or not that's true for the original. [Direct link](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/b/b5/List-cain.txt).

Several years ago, a list of phished MySpace accounts [was publicly released](http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2006/12/72300). If you want the complete list (with emails), it was posted with the name "myspace1.txt.bz2" and is pretty easy to find.  
I removed the usernames from the list and ordered it by frequency. You can find that list [here](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/7/72/List-myspace.txt) (if you still want the counts, you can get that [here](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/c/c5/Myspace-counts.txt)).

And finally, the story that reminded me to do this: the [Top 500 Worst Passwords](http://www.whatsmypass.com/?p=415). This list is the smallest I have, but is supposedly the 500 most common passwords used today. It's also ordered by frequency, and can be found [here](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/c/ca/500-worst-passwords.txt).

You might also find [this](http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/8/82/English.txt) useful, it's a list of all words in the English language. Maybe not useful for this, but if you're writing a hangman solver (and

When I'm doing bruteforcing and cracking, I always have trouble finding good lists of passwords.

Hey all,

Just a quick note -- I updated my blog template a bit. On the right, I added some new links and I added some info about myself at the top. I also added "previous" and "next" links above the posts. Hopefully these changes make it easier to get around. Let me know if I broke anything in the process!

That's all for today!  
Ron

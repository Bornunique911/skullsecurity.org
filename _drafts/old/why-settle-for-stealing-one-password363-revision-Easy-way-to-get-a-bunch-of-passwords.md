This is just a quick thought I had at work today (maybe I need to start using Twitter for random thoughts.. ack!)

Anyway, I was having trouble logging into our issue-tracking solution today. It's been awhile since I logged in, since I generally go through the Helpdesk (Helldesk?), so I wasn't sure exactly what I used for a password. So, I guessed the one I'd most likely use. Didn't work. I tried another two or three common passwords, then gave up and called for a reset.

My point? Well, if an attacker was watching my traffic, they just got a sample set of passwords that may be used for other servers (assuming, of course, that I don't use a different password for every service).

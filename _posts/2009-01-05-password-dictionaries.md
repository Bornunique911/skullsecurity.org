Greetings from 2009! 

I have a real post planned for the near future, but for now you're stuck with something short (and probably more useful, ultimately). I just wanted to draw attention to a few password databases I put on my wiki. You can find them <a href='http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords'>here</a>. 
<!--more-->
First, the list included with <strong>John the Ripper</strong>. It's small, at 24kb, and is designed to be mutated/permutated. It's ordered by frequency, and the author has done a lot of research on common/weak passwords. There's a direct link <a href='http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/5/53/List-john.txt'>here</a>, and due to its size it's probably the best list for online cracking.

Next, the list included with <strong>Cain and Able</strong>. It's significantly larger (3.3mb) and is targeted toward local cracking. The list I've uploaded it alphabetized, I'm not sure whether or not that's true for the original. <a href='http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/b/b5/List-cain.txt'>Direct link</a>. 

Several years ago, a list of phished MySpace accounts <a href='http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2006/12/72300'>was publicly released</a>. If you want the complete list (with emails (ie, usernames)), it was posted with the name "myspace1.txt.bz2" and is pretty easy to find.
I removed the usernames from the list and ordered it by frequency. You can find that list <a href='http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/7/72/List-myspace.txt'>here</a> (if you want to know how many people used each password on the list, check <a href='http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/c/c5/Myspace-counts.txt'>here</a>). 

And finally, the story that reminded me to do this: the <a href='http://www.whatsmypass.com/?p=415'>Top 500 Worst Passwords</a>. This list is the smallest I have, but is supposedly the 500 most common passwords used today. It's also ordered by frequency, and can be found <a href='http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/c/ca/500-worst-passwords.txt'>here</a>. 

You might also find <a href='http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/images/8/82/English.txt'>this</a> useful, it's a list of all words in the English language. Maybe not useful for cracking passwords, but if you're writing a hangman solver (and the author likes using words like "mesoblaster"), it could be what you need. 

When I'm doing bruteforcing and cracking, I always have trouble finding good lists of passwords. That's why I created that page in the first place, and I hope it helps others.

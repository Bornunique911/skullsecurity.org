Hey all,

I'll be presenting at Toorcon San Diego in a couple week (<a href='http://sandiego.toorcon.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=3&Itemid=9'>finalized lineup</a>, <a href='http://sandiego.toorcon.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=24&Itemid=9'>my talk!</a>).

As a bonus, I got business cards that say "SkullSecurity.org" printed out this week. They're really nice, and I'm hoping to give them out. If you'll be at Toorcon, come find me and I'll give you one (provided I don't give them all out in the next two weeks :) ). 

Looking forward to seeing some of you there! 
Ron

This is just a quick shout out to Michel Chamberland over at the SecurityWire blog. He wrote a <a href=http://blog.securitywire.com/2009/10/10/nmap-nse-script-to-enumerate-iscsi-targets/>Script to enumerate iSCSI Targets</a>. Unfortunately, I don't have any iSCSI to test on, but if you do he'd love to hear from you!

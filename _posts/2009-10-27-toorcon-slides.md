Hey all,

Thanks for everybody who came out to my Toorcon talk! I had a great weekend, even the part where I got stuck in San Fransisco and spent two full days getting home. Oops :)

A couple people asked me if I'd put up my slides, so here you go:
<a href='http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/security/2009-10-toorcon/2009-10%20Toorcon.pdf'>http://svn.skullsecurity.org:81/ron/security/2009-10-toorcon/2009-10%20Toorcon.pdf</a>

(If you want the original OpenOffice format, directory listings are enabled on that server)

Thanks once again, and it was great to meet all of you!

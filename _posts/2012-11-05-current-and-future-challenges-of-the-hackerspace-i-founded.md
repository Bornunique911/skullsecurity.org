Hey everybody,

This is just a super quick post today to direct you <a href='http://www.skullspace.ca/blog/2012/11/skullspace-2-0-the-new-frontier/'>here</a> - <a href='http://www.skullspace.ca/blog/2012/11/skullspace-2-0-the-new-frontier/'>http://www.skullspace.ca/blog/2012/11/skullspace-2-0-the-new-frontier/</a>.

That's a post I wrote about SkullSpace - the hackerspace that me and several others helped found a couple years ago. We went down a "too good to be true" road, where we had a ton of space and super cheap rent. And, eventually, got bitten by it. We're in the process of moving, and started a <a href='http://www.indiegogo.com/skullspace'>fundraiser</a> to make it happen.

Anyway, <a href='http://www.skullspace.ca/blog/2012/11/skullspace-2-0-the-new-frontier/'>read the post</a>! It's interesting. :)

Ron

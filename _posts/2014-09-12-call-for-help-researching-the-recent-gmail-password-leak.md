Hey folks,

You probably heard this week about <a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/09/11/google-says-not-to-worry-about-5-million-gmail-passwords-leaked/'>5 million @gmail.com accounts</a> posted. I've been researching it independently, and was hoping for some community help (this is <em>completely</em> unrelated to the fact that I work at Google - I just like passwords).

I'm reasonably sure that the released list is an amalgamation of a bunch of other lists and breaches. But I don't know what ones - that's what I'm trying to find out!

Which brings me to how you can help: people who can recognize which site their password came from. I'm trying to build a list of which breaches were aggregated to create this list, in the hopes that I can find breaches that were previously unreported!

<strong>If you want to help:</strong>

<ul>
  <ol>1. Check your email address on <a href='https://haveibeenpwned.com/'>https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a></ol>
  <ol>2. If you're in the list, email <a href='mailto:ihazhacked@skullsecurity.org'>ihazhacked@skullsecurity.org</a> <strong>from the associated account</strong></ol>
  <ol>3. I'll tell you the password that was associated with that account</ol>
  <ol>4. And, most importantly, you tell me which site you used that password on!</ol>
</ul>

In a couple days/weeks (depending on how many responses I get), I'll release the list of providers!

Thanks! And, as a special 'thank you' to all of you, <a href='https://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/alleged-gmail-with-count.txt.bz2'>here are the aggregated passwords</a> from the breach! And no, I'm not going to release (or keep) the email list. :)

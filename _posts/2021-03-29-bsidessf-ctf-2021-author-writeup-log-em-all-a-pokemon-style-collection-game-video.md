This is a video walkthrough of Log 'em All, a difficult Hacking / Reverse Engineering challenge based on a classic bug in Pokemon Red. You can view the video below, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY5V-vvipK4">directly on Youtube</a>.

I've never done a video-based writeup before, so I'd love feedback!

If you want to run this yourself, from a Linux computer with Docker (and a user in the appropriate group), run:
<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/BSidesSF/ctf-2021-...â€‹
$ cd ctf-2021-release/logemall/challenge
$ docker build . -t test
$ docker run -p666:666 --rm -ti test
</pre>
(Then in another window)
<pre>$ nc -v localhost 666

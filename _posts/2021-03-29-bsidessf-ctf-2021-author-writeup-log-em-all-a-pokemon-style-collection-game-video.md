This is a video walkthrough of Log 'em All, a difficult Hacking / Reverse Engineering challenge based on a classic bug in Pokemon Red. You can view the video below, or [directly on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY5V-vvipK4).

I've never done a video-based writeup before, so I'd love feedback!

If you want to run this yourself, from a Linux computer with Docker (and a user in the appropriate group), run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BSidesSF/ctf-2021-...â€‹
$ cd ctf-2021-release/logemall/challenge
$ docker build . -t test
$ docker run -p666:666 --rm -ti test
```

(Then in another window)

```
$ nc -v localhost 666
```
